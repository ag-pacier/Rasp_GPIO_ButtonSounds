# Rasp_GPIO_ButtonSounds
Turn your Raspberry Pi into a sound player with a button push.

The first run script assumes a Raspberry Pi that has just been freshly setup with Rasbian (lite or full image doesn't matter) and will set it up appropriately for you. All you need to do after it runs is to place sounds in a new folder /home/pi/sounds and reboot.
